# Detecting Fake News with Python and Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Detecting Fake News with Python and Machine Learning** repository! This project demonstrates how to classify news articles as 'FAKE' or 'REAL' using machine learning techniques. The interactive Jupyter Notebook allows you to experiment with different data splits and visualize model performance.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean news data.
- **Text Vectorization**: Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Train a Passive Aggressive Classifier for news classification.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Use Jupyter Notebook widgets to adjust parameters and visualize results.
